Takes in a CSV string and it parses out the headers and
the row. Each row is supposed to correspond to a
`CostCode`. Cost Codes are in a tree structure, each one
_can_ have a parent. Each one has a code, usually a two
digit number. 

Codes are identified by their `full_code`, for example a
CostCode with `code = 01` and a parent with code `01`
has a `full_code` of `01-01`. 

*New Feature Request*
Client wants to be able to upload a CSV with 3 tiers (currently only accepts /
works with 2)
